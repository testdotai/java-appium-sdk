The test.ai SDK is a seamless and painless way to AI-ify your Appium test cases by leveraging AI (specifically computer vision).

It will automatically ingest your data (screenshots and element names) as your run the test cases for the first time. After that the AI will act as back up when the selectors are broken and try to visually identify elements.

Another feature of the SDK is the ability to build test cases interactively and visually, using element names instead of CSS / Xpath selectors. It's user-friendly and very quick.

A nice side-effect is that it allows you to write cross-platform test cases that work for both iOS and Android with the same elements.
No more breaking tests.
